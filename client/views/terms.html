Doyouwana charges a flat fee of 5% on all payments collected. The service works with Braintree to ensure that all donations are transferred automatically and securely– and in real-time .If you're raising money for your favorite charity, those payments are processed by FirstGiving and are delivered to your selected charity or non-profit at least once per quarter (often times more frequently).

In addition to Doyouwana’s 5% fee, users are also agreeing to one of the following fees, along with the linked Terms & Conditions:
Braintree, charges a fee of 2.9% AND $0.30 per transaction. Read Braintree’s Term’s and Conditions

In addition, FirstGiving charges a flat fee of 4.25%. Read FirstGiving's Terms & Conditions.
All fees are deducted from each transaction automatically so you're never billed for anything.
Doyouwana is not the same company as Braintree or FirstGiving and their fees and commissions are subject to change without notice from us.

As a Doyouwana user, the online donation page you publish will be publicly available on the internet, for all to see, including search engines like Google and Yahoo. There are no private or hidden DoyouWana donation pages. Your activity is public.

You are independently responsible for complying with all applicable laws in all of your actions related to your use of Doyouwana’s services, regardless of the purpose of the use. In addition, you must adhere to the terms of this Acceptable Use Policy.

A SPECIAL NOTE TO REGULATORY AGENCIES
We do not engage in any solicitation activities; such activities are carried out by our users on their own initiative. Additionally, our "Charity Donations" are processed through a separate business entity, FirstGiving.
